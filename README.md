## Purpose: 
The reason why I created this website is for personal use, I wanted to experiment how the website should look, function and operate.
I added my favourite game to this which is assassins creed to show my interest of gaming. It has a grey, gold and crimson color schemes.
This is my first time creating a portfolio and I am justing seeing what works.

## Functionailty: 
The website functionailty is fairly simple, the importance of website making is responsiveness. I have tried many times and struggled creating a responsive 
website. It is easy to use on any device. It is fairly basic, nothing complex but I hopefully could add more features in the future.
